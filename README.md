# CH348 USB to Octal Serial PCB shell

## Disclaimer

I know nothing about CAD or 3D printing.
Code was generated with the help of [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/).
For cases where AI was unable to provide working code it was at least helpful enough to point out mistakes (claiming that I made a mistake...) and starting points to fix things.

## XB_250312_0075

Markings on the bottom of the board:
- `XB0201348` `Version: 4`
- `250312_0075`
- QR code that reads: `XB_250312_0075`

`v0.2` has gone productive for me, with the following caveats:
- text is hard to read
- dots (for the direction markers) had to be added manually in post
- there's a 1mm gap at the top, which is nothing that Blu Tack on the bottom (floor) of the shell can't fix

## Credits

Special thanks to [@cykedev](https://github.com/cykedev) for printing the shell and for swapping the filament to make the text easier to read.
